This is one of many projects I've worked on in my quest to become a web developer.  It is from the Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann titled "The Complete JavaScript Course: From Zero to Expert".  This was a tutorial style project.  I've made minimal changes to the style, and refactored the JavaScript code.

Like the Drum Kit project, this project introduced Event Listeners and using JavaScript to modify page contents.  I liked this project a little more though because I was able to practice multiple related concepts beyond Event Listeners, such as developing game logic, and differing button functionality.  

I feel like I'm getting a much better handle on DOM syntax and JavaScript function building.  

I've uploaded it here to continue documenting my journey.  When I am better with CSS, I hope to revisit this, and other similar tutorial projects, to enhance functionality and develop my own design.
